    <p class="song-lyrics">[Chester Bennington:] <br>
[Mike Shinoda:] <br>
One thing I don't know why <br>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try <br>
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <br>
To explain in due time</p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">[Chester Bennington:] <br>
All I know <br>
[Mike Shinoda:] Time is a valuable thing <br>
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings <br>
Watch it count down to the end of the day <br>
The clock ticks life away</p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">[Chester Bennington:] <br>
It's so unreal <br>
[Mike Shinoda:] <br>
It's so unreal, didn't look out below <br>
Watch the time go right out the window <br>
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know <br>
I wasted it all just to watch you go</p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">[Chester Bennington:] <br>
Watch you go <br>
[Mike Shinoda:] <br>
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart <br>
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard</p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">[Chester Bennington:] <br>
I tried so hard <br>
And got so far <br>
But in the end <br>
It doesn't even matter <br>
I had to fall <br>
To lose it all <br>
But in the end <br>
It doesn't even matter</p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">[Mike Shinoda:] <br>
One thing, I don't know why <br>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try <br>
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <br>
To remind myself how I tried so hard</p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">[Chester Bennington:] <br>
I tried so hard <br>
[Mike Shinoda:] <br>
In spite of the way you were mocking me <br>
Acting like I was part of your property <br>
Remembering all the times you fought with me <br>
I'm surprised it got so far</p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">[Chester Bennington:] <br>
Got so far <br>
[Mike Shinoda:] <br>
Things aren't the way they were before <br>
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore <br>
Not that you knew me back then <br>
But it all comes back to me in the end</p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">[Chester Bennington:] <br>
In the end <br>
[Mike Shinoda:] <br>
You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart <br>
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard</p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">[Chester Bennington:] <br>
I tried so hard <br>
And got so far <br>
But in the end <br>
It doesn't even matter <br>
I had to fall <br>
To lose it all <br>
But in the end <br>
It doesn't even matter</p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">I've put my trust in you <br>
Pushed as far as I can go <br>
For all this <br>
There's only one thing you should know</p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">I've put my trust in you <br>
Pushed as far as I can go <br>
For all this <br>
There's only one thing you should know </p>

    <p class="song-lyrics">I tried so hard <br>
And got so far <br>
But in the end <br>
It doesn't even matter <br>
I had to fall <br>
To lose it all <br>
But in the end <br>
It doesn't even matte <br>
and bopping them on the head!</p>
